                    <p>Forbes was found at the pound with an irritated coat and bloody feet. He wasn’t being adopted because no one knew what was wrong with him. 2 Hearts 4 Paws Refuge helped find a vet who diagnosed the problem – a severe allergic reaction to wood chips – and provided extreme allergy treatments. Now Forbes is happy and part of a young family with two kids.</p>
                    <p>Jaxson lets his brother, Leo, lay his head across his legs. They really love each other.</p>
                    <p>“I adopted Jaxson 2 years ago in July. 2Hearts4Pawsrefuge was a great resource every step of the way. I send them photos and updates on Jaxson, so they know how well he is doing. Jaxson got along instantly with his new brother Leo. Jaxson realized he was in a safe place where he was loved and cared for at all times. When I take Jaxson for walks my neighbors comment on how much Jaxson has changed. He even lets others pet him. Jaxson has such a cute personality. He has brought so much fun, love, and energy into our lives. Thank you Hearts4Paws.”</p>
                    <p>“I first saw Emma’s pictures online. From that moment I knew in my heart that she needed to come and live with me. Three days into the trial period I was more sure than ever. I adopted her in October 2016. I have never doubted that she and I were meant to be companions forever! Emma is blind and has health issues but I am home bound senior and have my own health issues. We are going through our life together taking it day by day.” – Robynn Peterson</p>

        <section class="about-us-short">
            <p>2 Hearts 4 Paws is a non-profit organization run by volunteers whose shared goal is to rescue, provide sanctuary, and ultimately to re-home abandoned, stray, and neglected animals. We never discriminate on the basis of health, age, or breed. By involving and educating the community, we work to raise the public’s awareness of the plight of homeless animals as well as realizing the benefits of adopting an animal in need. Our animals are examined, vaccinated, spayed or neutered, and receive any and all medical treatment before they are placed in carefully screened homes. 2 Hearts 4 Paws Refuge is a 501(c) nonprofit organization.</p>
